# 🏥 Hospital Insurance Billing System

## Overview

This project is a Python-based application designed by a team of 5 developers to automate billing in hospitals. It takes patient details, services received, and insurance information to calculate the final balance the patient owes after insurance deductions.

The system supports major insurance companies like **Medicaid** and **United Healthcare** and generates a final billing summary that includes a detailed breakdown of services, insurance coverage, and patient responsibilities.
